# Paste'n'playlist!

Live at [https://pasteandplaylist.now.sh](https://pasteandplaylist.now.sh)

Paste a list of songs with the pattern: Iron Maiden - Run to the hills (artist name - song title) and the tool will try to create a playlist with the spotify tracks found. You can choose to add the results to an existing playlist or create a new one.

This project uses now.sh as a hosting solution.
